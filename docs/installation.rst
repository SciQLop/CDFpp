Stable release
--------------

To install PyCDFpp, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install pycdfpp
    # or
    $ python -m pip install --user pycdfpp

This is the preferred method to install PyCDFpp, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
